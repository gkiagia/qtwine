=======================
To install from source:
=======================
Extract the source, open a terminal in the source directory and type:
$ mkdir b
$ cd b
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ su
# make install

This will install qtwine in /usr/local/bin. To change the target prefix
directory, run "ccmake .." after "cmake ..", change CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
and press c and g.

You will need Qt 4.3.0 or later libraries and headers to compile successfully.

=============
To uninstall:
=============
Just delete the executables "qtwine" and "qtwine-terminal-helper"
from $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin (by default /usr/local/bin).

Other data you may want to delete too, include:
- Settings, which are saved in ~/.config
- User data, which are saved in ~/.qtwine
