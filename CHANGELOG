Changes in trunk:
 - Split the project into a shared library and an executable.
 - Port to the KDE4 api.
 - Code now requires Qt 4.4 or later.

Changes in 0.4:
 - Code rewritten from scratch.
 - Redesigned GUI.
 - The wine configurations directory is now in ~/.qtwine/configurations.
 - Added support for using custom wine installations other than the ones at /usr or /usr/local.
 - Added support for detecting debian's wine packages and getting rid of the ugly green windows from codeweavers.
 - Added support for creating and shortcuts to installed windows applications.
 - Fixed more bugs of the *.reg file installer when using windows 5.x registry files.
 - Changed command line options to be more useful.
 - Added a dbus interface (warning: work in progress, it may not work as expected!!).
 - Some features like the settings dialog and the shell script exporter were removed because I simply didn't port them :P. They will be added again in 0.5

Changes in 0.3.1:
 - Added option to specify the location of the wine binary
 - Fixed some bugs

Changes in 0.3:
 - Now using Qt4 model/view architecture for handling configurations
 - Wine's default configuration (~/.wine) can now be used and there is the ability to turn it on/off
 - The directory where configurations rely can now be changed from the options dialog.
 - QtWine now has the ability to create small shell scripts that launch windows applications.
 - Added new command line options. --workdir allows changing the working directory of the windows application that will be executed and --options opens the options dialog. Run qtwine --help to see more information on command line options.
 - Additionally, the --log=/path/to/logfile.log option has been changed so that instead of the equal sign (=) you use a space like this --log /path/to/logfile.log
 - Fixed preview of binary .reg files created with windows regedit 5 and later (Windows 2k, XP, 2003, Vista)
 - Tuned for Wine 0.9.21 and later. The DOS Prompt button now runs cmd.exe instead of wcmd.exe
 - Added buttons for launching the following winelib applications: wordpad, iexplore, oleview and clock :-)
 - All windows and dialogs are now resizable
 - Dropped the create configuration wizard. Created a new simpler dialog for creating configurations.
 - As a result of the above change, Qt3 support libraries are no longer needed.
 - Sidenet was removed. There is no plan to use sidenet or wine tools in the future.
 - Reactos explorer button was removed
 - Many fixes in the code.

Changes in 0.2

- Launcher and reginstaller now remember their settings (i.e. which checkboxes were on, what text was in the lineEdits).
- Reginstaller now shows a preview of the .reg file next to the configurations list.
- Added a "Run windows application" menu option in manager for easy launching of windows apps.
- Added a "Create" button in launcher to allow creating a new configuration instantly, just before running a windows app.
- Some parts of the code were rewritten. The startwine class became WineLauncher and was rewritten from scratch.
- Added some tooltips
- Also: removed libc.so.6 (because it was causing trouble) and added libstdc++.so.6 in the binary package.
