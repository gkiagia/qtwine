Usage
=====
When qtwine is run without any arguments, it opens the main window.

To run a windows *.exe program, type:
        qtwine program.exe

To install a windows registry (*.reg) file in one of your wine configurations, type:
        qtwine file.reg

To launch an .exe file without seeing the qtwine gui, type:
        qtwine --configuration configuration_name_or_id program.exe arguments
    or  qtwine -c configuration_name_or_id program.exe arguments

In the last case, arguments are the arguments passed to program.exe.
If some of the arguments are unix filenames, they are converted to the windows format automatically.
If the filenames, though, point to nonexistent files, they are not converted.

To use the wine's default configuration (~/.wine) use:
        qtwine -c 1 program.exe

I recommend associating *.exe and *.reg files with qtwine so that when you
click a *.exe file in you file manager (ex. konqueror), qtwine launches
to run the *.exe file in its environment.

For more options, run "qtwine -h".
